# syncpack-github-action

A GitHub Action to Synchronise monorepo dependency versions with [`syncpack`](https://github.com/JamieMason/syncpack).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

[`syncpack`](https://github.com/JamieMason/syncpack) is stable but this GitHub Action is very new (May 15th 2022).

## üå© Installation

1. Create a [`.syncpackrc`](https://github.com/JamieMason/syncpack#-configuration-file) file in the root of your project.
   ```json
   {
     "dev": true,
     "filter": ".",
     "indent": "  ",
     "overrides": true,
     "peer": true,
     "prod": true,
     "resolutions": true,
     "workspace": true,
     "semverGroups": [],
     "semverRange": "",
     "sortAz": [
       "contributors",
       "dependencies",
       "devDependencies",
       "keywords",
       "peerDependencies",
       "resolutions",
       "scripts"
     ],
     "sortFirst": ["name", "description", "version", "author"],
     "source": [],
     "versionGroups": []
   }
   ```
1. Create a `/.github/workflows/syncpack.yml` workflow to run syncpack on Pull Requests.

   ```yaml
   on:
     # Run whenever a pull request is updated
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main
   jobs:
     syncpack:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       name: syncpack
       steps:
         # Check out the branch so we can read/write its files
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         # Use Node.js as syncpack is written in that
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: 16
         - uses: JamieMason/syncpack-github-action@0.2.3
           env:
             # If any options are set to 'fix' then
             # env.GITHUB_TOKEN is needed to push to PRs
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

1. Unless you don't plan to use `fix` to commit automatic fixes to your Pull Requests, go to `/settings/actions` in your repository and enable **Read and write permissions** under **Workflow permissions**.
